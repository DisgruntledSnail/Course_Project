                On Communication
            </h3>
            <p>
                I have spent my entire career up to this point working in third party logistics or 3PLs. I started as a floor hand processing returns for a shoe company and worked my way up to a team lead position over the admin team for one of our cosmetic clients. Now, I am working on a development degree and a shift to our company's IT department. This puts me in a unique position where I am able to see both the operational side of the business and the technological side of the business. Further, I can see how they compliment each other and, critically, how they clash with each other. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These clashes come from a lack of mutual understanding. What I have seen is that operations does not understand the limits of the technology that we are working with while IT does not understand how operations uses the technologies they are deploying. How can we solve this type of problem?
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel like saying "communication" is a bit of a cop-out, so to say. Communication is obvious, but it requires more than one side explaining to the other what is needed. It requires that the other side <em>listens</em> to what the first is saying. The talks become fruitless if afterwards the tack remains the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further still, both parties need to understand that they may not be able to get exactly what they want. Operations needs to understand that their desired solution may be out of reach either practically or financially. While IT should understand that they may have to extend project scope to meet the requirements of operations and clients. It is only with flexibility and understanding that both departments can come together and deliver solutions that work for our teams and our clients.
