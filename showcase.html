                <p>
                   After spending many years as an admin in third party logistics (3PL), I found myself both seriously unhappy with and able to do something about how warehouse management systems or WMSs worked. They were either fast, outdated, difficult to learn mainframe applications or sleek, new, inefficent web apps. I thought to myself one day; "self, you can make a WMS that is as powerful and efficient as a mainframe and user friendly as a web app". Mollusk_WMS is the result of that work.
